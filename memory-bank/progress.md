## What's Left to Build 📝

### High Priority
1. **Auto-update System**
   - Electron updater integration
   - Update server configuration
   - User notification system

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Virtual scrolling for large account lists
   - Lazy loading improvements
   - Memory usage optimization

3. **Enhanced Role Management**
   - Custom role aliases/titles
   - Role grouping/tagging
   - Bulk role operations

### Medium Priority
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Global hotkeys for role switching
   - Search keyboard navigation
   - Quick command palette

2. **Advanced Search**
   - Fuzzy search algorithm
   - Search history
   - Advanced filters

3. **Session Management**
   - Multiple SSO session support
   - Session backup/restore
   - Automatic re-authentication

### Low Priority
1. **Analytics & Insights**
   - Usage statistics
   - Most used roles tracking
   - Session duration analytics

2. **Team Features**
   - Shared role configurations
   - Team templates
   - Collaboration tools

3. **Extended Integrations**
   - AWS CloudShell
   - Systems Manager Session Manager
   - CloudFormation stack management

## Known Issues 🐛

### Critical
- None currently identified

### Major
1. Large account lists (100+) can cause UI lag
2. Session expiration edge cases need handling
3. Settings cache may not update immediately

### Minor
1. Terminal button tooltips could be clearer
2. Some loading states could be smoother
3. Dark mode has minor contrast issues in places

## Technical Debt 💳

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some components are too large
   - Need better separation of concerns
   - More custom hooks for reusability

2. **Testing**
   - Limited test coverage
   - Need E2E tests for critical flows
   - Mock AWS SDK responses needed

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Component documentation needed
   - Architecture diagrams outdated

4. **Build Process**
   - Build time optimization needed
   - Bundle size reduction possible
   - Better code splitting strategy
